## Problem

To keep his cows intellectually stimulated, Farmer John has placed a large map of the USA on the wall of his barn. Since the cows spend many hours in the barn staring at this map, they start to notice several curious patterns. For example, the cities of Flint, MI and Miami, FL share a very special relationship: the first two letters of "Flint" give the state code ("FL") for Miami, and the first two letters of "Miami" give the state code ("MI") for Flint.

Let us say that two cities are a "special pair" if they satisfy this property and come from different states. The cows are wondering how many special pairs of cities exist. Please help them solve this amusing geographical puzzle!
