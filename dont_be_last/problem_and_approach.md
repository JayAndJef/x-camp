## Problem

Farmer John owns 7 dairy cows: Bessie, Elsie, Daisy, Gertie, Annabelle, Maggie, and Henrietta. He milks them every day and keeps detailed records on the amount of milk provided by each cow during each milking session. Not surprisingly, Farmer John highly prizes cows that provide large amounts of milk.

Cows, being lazy creatures, don't necessarily want to be responsible for producing too much milk. If it were up to them, they would each be perfectly content to be the lowest-producing cow in the entire herd. However, they keep hearing Farmer John mentioning the phrase "farm to table" with his human friends, and while they don't quite understand what this means, they have a suspicion that it actually may not be the best idea to be the cow producing the least amount of milk. Instead, they figure it's safer to be in the position of producing the second-smallest amount of milk in the herd. Please help the cows figure out which of them currently occupies this desirable position.
